            <h2>My Name is Sydnee Williams </h2>
            <p>I am a student at the University of Advancing Technology One of favorite Hobby is making Stained Glass Projects. 
                I started working on projects for an elective class in High School, and ever since, I started coming up with ideas
            and designed them during my free time. I have done a variety of different projects, starting of simple with small 2D designs,
            then moving to mosaics, and then to 3D objects like boxes. I want to create, share, and give my projects to those who would want
        to puchase my work. I enjoy making them, and I hope they love the designs I make with the Stained Glass.</p>
